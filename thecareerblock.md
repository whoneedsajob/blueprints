# The Career Block - Blueprint

## About blueprint
The Career Block blueprint is a ready-to-implement initiative to connect your startup society / pop-up city with local schools. It's a high-impact, replicable, and relatively low-effort way to give back to the community - and help students find direction in their careers early in life. This blueprint provides a framework that you can adapt to your specific context and resources. The core idea is to leverage the diverse talent within your startup society to create a memorable and valuable experience for students.
